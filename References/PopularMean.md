### Sample Mean Formula
The sample mean formula is:

x̄ = ( Σ xi ) / n

If that looks complicated, it’s simpler than you think (although check out our tutoring page if you need help!). Remember the formula to find an “average” in basic math? It’s the exact same thing, only the notation (i.e. the symbols) are just different. Let’s break it down into parts:

x̄ just stands for the “sample mean”
Σ is summation notation, which means “add up”
xi “all of the x-values”
n means “the number of items in the sample”
Now it’s just a matter of plugging in numbers that you’re given and solving using arithmetic (there’s no algebra required—you can basically plug this in to any calculator).

### You might see the following alternate sample mean formula:
x̄ = 1/ n * ( Σ xi )
The set up is slightly different, but algebraically it’s the same formula (if you simplify the formula 1/n * X, you get 1/X).
