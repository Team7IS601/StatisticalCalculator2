### Population Variance
Population variance (σ2) tells us how data points in a specific population are spread out. It is the average of the distances from each data point in the population to the mean, squared.

σ2 is usually represented as σ2 and can be calculated using the following formula:
population variance
Here N is the population size and the xi are data points. μ is the population mean.

Example
Sample question: Find the population variance of the age of children in a family of five children aged 16, 11, 9, 8, and 1:

Step 1: Find the mean, μx:
μ = 9.

Step 2: Subtract each data point from the mean, then square the result:
(16-9)2 = 49
(11-9)2 = 4
(9-9)2 = 0
(8-9)2 = 1
(1-9)2 = 64.

Step 3: Add up all of the squared differences from Step 2:
(16-9)2 + (11-9)2 + (9-9)2 + (8-9)2+ (1-9)2 = 118.

Step 4: Divide Step 3 by the number of items. 118/5 gives a population variance of 23.6.
